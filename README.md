# session-summaries

## This is a repository for all the session summaries from the Beginners' Python Support Sessions held in Brisbane.

In these folders you will encounter three different types of files.

    + readme.md     is a markdown file. You do not need to do anything except read these files.

    + readme.py     is a python file that usually contains scripts to be run in your python IDE. 
                    You need to download and save the file in order to run it.

    + readme.ipynb  is an ipython notebook file that you can either read on github or download to run.
                    To run the file you will need a notebook interpreter such as Jupyter notebooks or 
                    you can install jupyter using pip in a python virtual environment in your python console 
                    so you donâ€™t have the full anaconda install but can still run jupyter notebooks from your 
                    local server. If you are a beginner, this is not recommended.
